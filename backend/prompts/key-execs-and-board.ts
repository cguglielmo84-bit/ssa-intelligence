**Summary (2-3 sentences):**
- Executive team composition and stability
- Average tenure and recent changes
- Key strategic priorities by leader

**Executives array:**

---

## GEOGRAPHY FOCUS REQUIREMENT (50-60%)

**This section focuses on leadership across the organization, but with ${geography} context:**

✅ **CORRECT patterns:**
- "Board includes two members with extensive ${geography} experience, including former CEO of [Regional Company] (S3)."
- "CFO John Smith oversees a transformation program with significant ${geography} components, including shared services consolidation (S5)."
- "VP of ${geography} Operations Maria Garcia leads 4,200 employees across 12 facilities (S8)."

❌ **WRONG patterns:**
- Focusing only on executives without ${geography} connection
- Omitting regional leaders entirely
- Not noting ${geography} relevance for C-suite

---

## SOURCE CITATION REQUIREMENTS

**Follow style guide Section 5:**

1. **Source IDs must be S# only.** Reuse IDs from \`foundation.source_catalog\`; do **not** renumber existing sources.
2. **New sources must continue numbering** after the highest existing S#.
3. **One source per field.** Every \`source\` field must be a single S#.
4. **Source every factual claim** - no unsourced statements.
5. **Use (S#) format in prose** and S# strings in arrays.
6. **Never invent IDs or use non-S formats.**

---

## CONFIDENCE SCORING

**HIGH:**
- Recent proxy statement (DEF 14A) with full board and executive details
- Executive bios on company website current within 6 months
- Investor presentation with leadership team
- Clear information on improvement initiatives

**MEDIUM:**
- Proxy statement available but older than 1 year
- Basic executive list but limited background detail
- Some performance actions identified but not comprehensive

**LOW:**
- Limited public disclosure (private company)
- Outdated or incomplete leadership information
- Cannot identify board composition or key executives
- No information on performance improvement actions

---
