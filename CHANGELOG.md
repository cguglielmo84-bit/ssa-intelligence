# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Remove `z-10` from content wrapper in Layout that created a stacking context trapping modals behind the header and sidebar.
- Add `backdrop-blur-sm` to Prompt Library edit modal overlay to match the rest of the app.
- Render all modals and toasts via React portals to `document.body` so backdrop blur covers the full viewport including the sticky header.
- Add missing `backdrop-blur-sm` to UserAddModal, UserEditModal, and CompanyResolveModal overlays.
- Center company reports modal vertically instead of top-aligned.

### Refactored
- Add `vite-env.d.ts` and remove all `(import.meta as any)` casts across 12 frontend files — uses Vite's built-in `ImportMeta` types instead.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-12

### Changed
- Rename admin "Bug Reports" page to "Research Failures" to distinguish from user-facing "Report Issue" feature.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- Automatic bug report creation on permanent research stage failures — captures error details, category, severity, and sanitized context (`backend/src/services/bug-report.ts`).
- Admin bug reports dashboard (`#/admin/bugs`) with summary cards, filter bar, paginated table, detail modal with status management and resolution notes.
- AI-agent-queryable endpoint (`GET /api/admin/bug-reports/agent-query`) with fingerprint grouping, pattern detection, and suggested actions per error category.
- Invite-only access system — new users default to PENDING status; super-admin can generate invite links; users accept invites to become ACTIVE; frontend gates pending users with activation page.
- Super-admin role (SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL env var) with dedicated middleware guard for user/group/invite management.
- News Intelligence module: multi-layer news fetching (RSS/API + AI search), article pinning, bulk archive, PDF/Markdown export, deep dive search with company name resolution.
- Admin activity dashboard with engagement metrics, filters, and analytics.
- User activity tracking (article opens, link clicks, page views, exports).
- User call diet configuration replacing revenue-owner model.

### Fixed
- DotGrid background canvas no longer overlaps interactive page content on non-dashboard tabs.
- Frontend loading-state gate prevents app shell flash for pending users.
- News integration tests use admin auth to match route middleware requirements (requireAdmin, articleUsers scoping).
- Add Invite table to test truncateAll() to prevent FK constraint failures.
- Remove stale `migrate resolve --rolled-back` hack from Dockerfile CMD.
- Add missing migration to replace RevenueOwner-based junction tables with User-based tables (fixes production 500s on all `/api/news/*` endpoints).
- Layout overflow causing content clipping at viewport bottom.
- Security: non-admin users can no longer view other users' articles via `?userId=` query param.
- Security: batch PDF/Markdown export endpoints now verify article access for non-admin users (403 on unauthorized IDs).
- Duplicate pins router mount that shadowed other `/api/news/*` routes.
- Initial unscoped fetch in NewsDashboard for non-admin users.
- PDF export: corrupt logo, empty all-articles export, text overlap issues.
- Integration test `db-helpers.ts` updated for renamed/removed Prisma models.

### Changed
- `clear-news-data.sql` updated with current table references and wrapped in transaction.
- Activity tracker fetch fallback now includes `credentials: 'include'` and logs 401 errors.

### Security
- Replace predictable CUID invite tokens with cryptographically secure `crypto.randomBytes(32)`.
- Fix race condition on invite acceptance with conditional `updateMany` inside interactive transaction.
- Tighten dev-fallback/impersonation guard from `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` to explicit `NODE_ENV === 'development' || DEV_MODE === 'true'`.
- Redact invite tokens from list response for used/expired invites.

### Refactored
- Extract shared domain-validation helpers to `backend/src/lib/domain-validation.ts`.

### UI
- Animated dot grid background with periodic wave animation.
- Conic gradient rotating border on "Start New Research" button.
- Sidebar scrollbar auto-hides when not actively scrolling.
- Improved header transparency, z-index layering, remove bottom border.
- Stacked date display and minimum card height on research dashboard cards.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-10

- Fix: remove redundant `status !== 'completed'` check in narrowed branch in ResearchDetail.
- Fix: (P1-4) add 9 stage output columns to ResearchJob for PE/FS/Insurance report types so outputs are saved on the parent job and available as context for downstream stages.
